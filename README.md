# VBA Challenge - Stock Analysis<br />
### Overview <br />
This purpose of this project is to create a workbook that allows the end user to anaylze stock performance for specific years. The previous exercise allowed for this, but now we are to edit or refactor the code. Refactoring is used to help the VBA script run faster and easier for future users to read. We will compare the stock performance for 12 stocks 2017 and 2018, and the difference in the original VBA script vs the refactured version.<br />

### Results <br />
Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.<br />

For this index of stocks, 2017 was a significantly better year compared to 2018. <br />

And in comparison 2018: <br />

In regard to refracted code versus original, the refracted code was faster to process. When working with a small dataset, this amount of time is not noticeable. However, this is a good metric and check that the changes are improvements.<br />

### Summary  <br />
In a summary statement, address the following questions:
1. What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code? <br />
2. How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script? <br />

The key advantages of refractoring code is that in the end, the script should run more efficiently (ie faster) and also be more legible. This allows for future users to be able to quickly understand the code, then make improvements or adjustments as needed instead of starting over. Also, there are many times when I have worked on a project and then forgotten the process and where I left off. Clean and efficient script is best for everyone involved. <br />

Disadvantages of refactoring code are that you may unintentionally add bugs or disrupt the functionality. In addition, the process requires time which could be use to develop other projects. <br />
