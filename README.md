# VBA Challenge - Stock Analysis<br />
## Overview <br />
This purpose of this project is to create a workbook that allows the end user to anaylze stock performance for specific years. The previous exercise allowed for this, but now we are to edit or refactor the code. Refactoring is used to help the VBA script run faster and easier for future users to read. We will compare the stock performance for 12 stocks 2017 and 2018, and the difference in the original VBA script vs the refactured version.<br />

###Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.


Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
